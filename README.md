# Udagram Image Filtering Microservice

This Udagram project is a simple cloud application. It allows users to register and log into a web client, post photos to the feed, and process photos using an image filtering microservice.

These are process I followed to finish the project

1. I Initialize a new project: `npm i`
2. I ran the development server with `npm run dev`

### Created a new endpoint in the server.ts file

### Deployed your system

Followed the process described in the course to `eb init` a new application and `eb create` a new environment to deploy your image-filter service! Don't forget you can use `eb deploy` to push changes.
